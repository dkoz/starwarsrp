# Star Wars RP
This starwars gamemode was created keeping customization in mind. You will need to gather the content packs yourself and customize the jobs with weapons and models. My goal is to provide the base code needed to start a server while maintaining the most basic layout.

Please do not ask me to help you configure this, it's only for people who know what they're doing.

## Features
+ Ready to modify jobs for Clone Wars.
+ Quality of life modules to get your server started.

## Requirements
> This is a derived gamemode and requires DarkRP as the base.
> DarkRP 2.7.0: https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP

## To do list~
+ Move away from the standard ULX Ranks for each job.
+ Create a whitelist allowing players to assign people to each job.
+ Create a third person module.
+ Add custom GUI including F4 Menu, Scoreboard, and HUD.

I'll add more later~
